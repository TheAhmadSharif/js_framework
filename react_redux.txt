npm is used to download JavaScript packages from Node Package Manager, and npx is used to execute JavaScript packages downloaded this way.


 NPX gives us a clear and easy way to run packages and helps us to avoid versioning, dependency issues, and installing unnecessary packages that we just want to test.
